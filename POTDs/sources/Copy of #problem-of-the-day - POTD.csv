\item He writes down the edges of the graph in increasing order of weight from left to right.
\item Starting from the edge with lowest weight and working from left to right he checks if the addition of that edge to the edges already chosen would form a cycle. If no cycle is formed he chooses this edge otherwise he discards it and moves onto the next edge in the list.

Two positive integers $k$ and $n$ are specified, along with a finite set $S$ of $k$-tuples of integers (not necessarily positive). At the start of the game, the $k$-tuple $(n, 0, 0, \ldots, 0)$ is written on the blackboard.\\[5pt]
A legal move consists of erasing the tuple $(a_1,a_2, \ldots,a_k)$ which is written on the blackboard and replacing it with $(a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2,  \ldots, a_k+b_k)$, where $(b_1, b_2,  \ldots, b_k)$ is an element of the set $S$. Two players take turns making legal moves, and the first to write a negative integer loses. In the event that neither player is ever forced to write a negative integer, the game is a draw.\\[5pt]
Prove that there is a choice of $k$ and $S$ with the following property: the first player has a winning strategy if $n$ is a power of 2, and otherwise the second player has a winning strategy.",,,,HELLO ETHAN!,,,,
